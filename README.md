# Online Retail Data Analysis

## Dataset
Online Retail Dataset (Kaggle)

---

## Objective
Analyze customer purchasing behavior and business performance using Python-based data analysis, SQL-style logic, and visual storytelling.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Kaggle Notebook  
- SQL logic implemented using Pandas  

---

## Project Workflow & Features

### 1. Data Loading & Cleaning
- Loaded raw e-commerce data  
- Handled missing values using drop and fill strategies  
- Removed invalid quantities and prices  
- Removed duplicate records  
- Converted `InvoiceDate` to datetime format  
- Created derived columns such as `Revenue` and `Date`

### 2. Statistical Analysis
- Calculated:
  - Mean  
  - Median  
  - Mode  
  - Variance  
- Analyzed data distribution using histograms  
- Studied relationships between variables using correlation  
- Visualized insights with scatter plots and heatmaps

### 3. SQL Logic Using Pandas
(SQL behavior replicated using Pandas operations)
- Filtering data (SELECT, WHERE)  
- Sorting and limiting results (ORDER BY, LIMIT)  
- Grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY, SUM, COUNT)  
- Customer-wise revenue analysis  
- Customer segmentation (High / Medium / Low spenders)  
- Ranking top customers by revenue

### 4. Data Visualization & Dashboard
- Bar chart: Revenue by Country  
- Line chart: Sales trend over time  
- Heatmap: Correlation between key metrics  
- KPI calculations:
  - Total Revenue  
  - Total Orders  
  - Average Order Value  
- Created a Python dashboard using multiple charts  
- Exported visualizations for reporting
